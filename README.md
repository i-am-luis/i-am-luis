# Looks like you want some fun 👋

🧑‍💻 I'm a Front-End Engineer from the vibrant shores of Costa Rica, on a mission to craft accessible and eye-catching web experiences. 🪄 I weave magic with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring everyone can navigate the digital world with ease ⛵️.

2. Championing web accessibility for all!👩‍🦽

## Tech Stack:

* HTML (the building blocks) 🧱
* CSS (the paintbrush) 👨‍🎨
* JavaScript (the brains) ⚙️
